SSD1306 PMOD (DSPI) Interface
=============================

This is a DSPI interface for the SSD1306 display as used on the
Digilent OLED PMOD and Basic IO Shield. This is a 128x32 display
with SPI interface. It has VDD and VBAT control but these aren't
actually needed for normal operation.

This library requires the SSD1306 "base" library to work.
